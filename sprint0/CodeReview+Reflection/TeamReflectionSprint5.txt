Reo Ogundare:
Through the efforts of Breece Pingle, Michael Yang, and I, this project is functional in certain respects.
The game has developed in a more rounded, less buggy way. 
In this sprint we've introduced a more complete health and damage system, complete enemy movement,pickups of certain items, 
keys that open doors, and some extraneous features.

Sprint 5 entailed adding another level that is accessible by pressing y. The new level includes new enemies and textures.
Certain features are not implemented in entirety as of december 7th 2022, 
those included are complete pause menu functionality, win state automatic functionality(currently press H to display win),
lava floor is not yet implemented, and tunnels activated by bombs are not active. known bugs include certain crashing due to loading,
moving out of bounds due to collision issues within doors, and general testmode unpredictable activity.

Michael Yang:
Reo, Breece and I keep on climbing, 
while other guys just fail to participate the group work with unknown reasons.

Although we sometimes feel overwhelmed, we survive. Our project is more and more like a game that can
be played by players.

Generally, I try to fix all kinds of bugs like collision between enemies and bounds, enmies and blocks, items and bounds,
and so on. And then I decide to implement the nightmare mode and puzzle elements. The nightmare has been finished while
for the puzzle elements, I have create some blocks can be detroyed by pickaxes and bombs which increase the freedom of the game.
There is few things left. We will deal that soon to combine those parts into a puzzle in the game. And to make the game 
looks better, I have updated some textures and make some buttons for UI interface.

All in all, the process is hard, but we learn quite a lot.

Breece Pingle:
Sprint 5 was handeled by Reo Ogundare, Michael Yang and I. I was able to
help with some areas, such as Link's taunt, pause menu, lose screen, win
screen, play state, and some miscellaneous features.
I do not even mention Yuxuan Song, Zhi Huang, or Nick Habeth, as they have been
unresponsive for most if not all of the work of this project. This makes
meeting deadlines extremely difficult, and overwhelming when considering the
other classes and work that Reo, Michael, and I may be experiencing.
