Reo Ogundare:
Through the efforts of Breece Pingle, Michael Yang, and I, this project is functional in certain respects.
The game has developed in a more rounded, less buggy way. 
In this sprint we've introduced a more complete health and damage system, complete enemy movement,pickups of certain items, 
keys that open doors, and some extraneous features.

Sprint 5 entailed adding another level that is accessible by pressing y. The new level includes new enemies and textures.
Certain features are not implemented in entirety as of december 7th 2022, 
those included are complete pause menu functionality, win state automatic functionality(currently press H to display win),
lava floor is not yet implemented, and tunnels activated by bombs are not active. known bugs include certain crashing due to loading,
moving out of bounds due to collision issues within doors, and general testmode unpredictable activity.
