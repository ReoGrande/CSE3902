The code linkToblocks written by Breece and link to bounds contain same code about handling block of link. I think we can write a function 
in Link class called LinkBlock().This can reduce the redundancy of code.
LinkBlock contains the blow code:
                    switch (link.GetDirection())
                    {
                        case Link.Direction.Up:
                            link.ChangePosition(new Rectangle(linkPos.X, bound.Bottom, linkPos.Width, linkPos.Height));
                            break;
                        case Link.Direction.Down:
                            link.ChangePosition(new Rectangle(linkPos.X, bound.Top - linkPos.Height, linkPos.Width, linkPos.Height));
                            break;
                        case Link.Direction.Left:
                            link.ChangePosition(new Rectangle(bound.Right, linkPos.Y, linkPos.Width, linkPos.Height));
                            break;
                        case Link.Direction.Right:
                            link.ChangePosition(new Rectangle(bound.Left - linkPos.Width, linkPos.Y, linkPos.Width, linkPos.Height));
                            break;
                        default:
                            break;
                    }

In linkToEnmies(Breece), I think we should change the code link.TakeDamage() when link is touched by enemy if link is not attacking.
As this will make it hard to expand the code if different enemies can yield different effects when touching link, like take more 
damage, decrease the speed of link and so on. So we can set a method called EnemyHitLink() in the IEnemy so to implement different 
codes for different enemies. And linkToBlock should also be changed into this way, as not all blocks will hinder Link such as 
ladder(take link to a different place) and fire(damages link instead of hinder link).

I have seen the code:

           _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.A, new Move(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.D, new Move(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.W, new Move(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.S, new Move(this));
            // _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.T, new PreviousBlock(this));
            // _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.Y, new NextBlock(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.Y, new SwitchLevel(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.Tab, new TestMode(this));

            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.U, new PreviousItem(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.I, new NextItem(this));
            //_controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.O, new PreviousEnemy(this));
            //_controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.P, new NextEnemy(this));
            //_controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.Z, new Attack(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.N, new Attack(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.D1, new UseFirstItem(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.D2, new UseSecondItem(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.D3, new UseThirdItem(this));
            //_controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.E, new TakeDamageOn(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.R, new Reset(this));
            //_controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.D9, new MuteSoundEffect(this));
            //_controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.D8, new MuteBackgroudMusic(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.G, new Pause(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.F, new Pause2(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.H, new Win(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.J, new Taunt(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.Q, new Quit(this));
            _controllers.RegisterCommand(Keys.Escape, new Quit(this));

In a couple of differenct places. I think, since this is our final sprint, we
could easily organize all of the commented commands into a block at the end,
with a "title" comment saying that they are "debugging" commands. This would
provide much better readability on code comments that we would rather not
delete.

We still need to use the version that is NOT in the
Game1 class itself, as this would be a very easy fix in making our code more
readable.

Code quality in the additional enemies added by Michael meets the same standard
of quality as the other enemies Michael has implemented. Excellent, efficient,
and easy to utilize in different classes by means of IEnemy.

IGameState.cs

GameState by Breece Pingle is excellently developed, each state is paired with gameState and IGamestate and allows ease of use 
and an ease in changing states. This works through the use of single click Commands in ICommand. This 
implimentation although can be improved with further utilization and with automatic changes to win 
state from play state when the player achieves a sufficient condition(obtaining the triforce)
