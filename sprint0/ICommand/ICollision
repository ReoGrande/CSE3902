////only have to check object associated with leaf.

////collision detection optimization, sort and sweep***
////order all object by some position scale (x or y position)
////after checking one object's collision status with adjacent objects, 
////no need to check for that specific object's collison status with following objects
////for [1,2,3,4,5] if 1 is not in collision with 2, no need to check if 1 is in collision with 3,4,5
////BOTH OPTIMIZATIONS ARE SPATIAL PARTITIONING ALGORITHMS

////COLLISION RESPONSE(software organization)
////Response logic could be encapsulated in dedicated classes.
////collision handler-->PlayerCollisionHandler

////Should separate collision detection and collision response

////detector vs handler

////All collision handler could use a dictionary
//// Key and Value pair
///object1 | object 2 | side | command
///Mario   | Block    | left | MoveMarioLeft
///...
///where mario,block,and left is the "key" as a set and MoveMarioLeft is the "value" in the dictionary
