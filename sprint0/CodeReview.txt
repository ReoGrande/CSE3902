Specific comments on code quality
    good readability and functionality, may be low in code cohesion as link state handles many different aspects.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
    MAy need to develop a specific handler for sprite movement in linkState. need to properly use IController and ICommand to process input.
